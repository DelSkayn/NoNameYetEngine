Shading:

Basic fragment color equation:

Color = Ambient * diffuse * specular * diffuseColor

Lambert diffuse:

Lambert diffuse is used in almost all games because its quick and
gives good results. There are other diffuse reflections functions,
but they are not really worth the extra cost. (differences in how
not shiny an object is hard to see)

Id = (L.N)*C*Il

Id = the intesity of the reflected light
L = the normalized light direction pointing from the surfuce to the light source
N = the normal vector of the surface
C = the color of the light

Not that hard really

Cook-Torrance specular

So Cook Torrance is somewhat more diffecult.
The basic function is as follow:
f = (D * F * G) / (4* (N.L) * (N.V));

where:
f = the specular
N = the normal vector of the surface
L = the normalized light direction pointing from the surfuce to the light source
V = the normalized viewer direction pointing from the surfuce to the camera

So far so good however we the D,F and G ar not yet explained Soooo:
D = the normal distribution function
F = the fresnel factor 
G = the Geometry shadowing term 

Each of these functions have there own model or approximations.
