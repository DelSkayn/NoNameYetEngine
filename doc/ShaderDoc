## Uniforms ##

* Uniform names a prediffined in NNYE. On attaching a shader 
all nessesary uniform locations are loaded to prediffined 
attach points? 

Why not just map the uniforms?
Speed, Probebly

Uniform names:
!! TEMP !!
    Matrixes:
    -- MVP matrix: uni_MVP
    -- MV matrix: uni_MV
    -- Projection matrix: uni_p

attributes:
    Location:
        0:Vertex vector
        1:normal vector
        2:texture coords vector

texture:
    Location:
        diffuse : tex_Diffuse
        normal + depth : tex_normal
        material : tex_material
