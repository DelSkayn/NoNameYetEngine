Goal: 
Get a quake clone running

Major Tasks:
- Networking:
    - udp connection protocol
    - basic over ip connection
    Not a task:
    - cheat security
- Rendering:
    - Expand rendering code:
        - Uniforms
            - Find a proper way to mannage them
        - lights
        - shaders
        - textures
        - etc
    - Defered rendering?
        - Prepass Lighting
        - Rendertargets
    - Physically based rendering
        ! Very basic lighting equation works
        # see research
    - Some higher level redendering construct:
        - Spatial tree?
        - Culling?
- physics:
    - basic rigid body physics
    - bullet physics
- UI:
    - basic UI system:
        - Menus
        - Health bars
        - etc
- Memory
    - Custom allocators
        - Change all new operator to own allocator?
    - Memory profilling
-profiling
    - Time
    - Memory
- Resources
    - Lexers
        # Need some research
    - Mesh Loaders
    - Shaders
    - Textures
- other:
    - make engine libary based

Minor Tasks:
- Redesign input
-
